<h2>Let's tell stories together.</h2>

<p>Stories is a collaborative storytelling game. The main thing you do is write, much as if you were sitting down to write a book.</p>

<p>You and your co-authors will receive a randomly-generated and theme-appropriate Environment. You can respond by taking the story in whatever direction you want!</p>

<p>The twist is that by writing frequently you gain Influence. Influence can be used to modify the current Environment. For example, the Environment might say "A giant ogre is here." You could spend Influence to remove the ogre. Then you could write the the removal of the ogre into your story! Did the hero slay it? Did it get bored and amble away? That's up to you!</p>
